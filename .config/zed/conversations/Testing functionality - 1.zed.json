{"id":"0be01faa-456e-47c7-acc1-745e0375fcb1","zed":"conversation","version":"0.2.0","text":"Write a short python script that uses pyairbyte\nTo write a Python script using `pyairbyte`, you first need to ensure that `pyairbyte` is installed in your environment. If it's not already installed, you can do so using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install pyairbyte\n```\n\nAssuming you want to list connectors from an Airbyte instance, follow the steps below. This example requires you to have access to an Airbyte server's API endpoint and its API token (if your Airbyte deployment requires authentication).\n\nThe following script demonstrates how to list available source connectors from an Airbyte server:\n\n```python\nfrom pyairbyte import AirbyteApiClient\nfrom pyairbyte.api import Configuration, WorkspaceApi, SourceDefinitionApi\n\n# Your Airbyte instance API URL\napi_url = \"http://localhost:8000/api/v1/\"\n# If you need authentication, provide your API token\n# For Open-source Airbyte, tokens might not be needed, so you can set api_token to None\napi_token = \"YOUR_API_TOKEN_HERE\"\n\ndef list_source_connectors(api_url: str, api_token: Optional[str] = None):\n    \"\"\"\n    List available source connectors from the Airbyte server.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize configuration for accessing the API\n    config = Configuration(host=api_url)\n\n    # If authentication is required, adjust the configuration to include the API token\n    if api_token:\n        config.access_token = api_token\n\n    # Initialize the Airbyte API client with the configuration\n    client = AirbyteApiClient(configuration=config)\n    \n    # Use the SourceDefinitionApi to interact with source definitions\n    source_api = SourceDefinitionApi(api_client=client)\n\n    try:\n        # Fetch all source definitions (connectors) available\n        response = source_api.list_source_definitions()\n\n        # Iterate and print the source names and their Docker repository names\n        for source in response.source_definitions:\n            print(f\"{source.name} - Docker image: {source.docker_repository}:{source.docker_image_tag}\")\n    \n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n\n# Entry point\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    list_source_connectors(api_url=api_url, api_token=api_token)\n```\n\n**Note:** Be sure to replace `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/` with the actual URL of your Airbyte API and `YOUR_API_TOKEN_HERE` with your actual API token if your Airbyte instance is secured.\n\nThis script demonstrates the basic usage of `pyairbyte` to query the API for source connectors information. You can similarly use other _Api classes (e.g., `WorkspaceApi`, `DestinationDefinitionApi`) to interact with other entities within the Airbyte configuration.\n","messages":[{"id":0,"start":0},{"id":5,"start":48},{"id":6,"start":2619}],"message_metadata":{"6":{"role":"user","sent_at":"2024-04-07T07:31:57.207734-07:00","status":"Done"},"1":{"role":"user","sent_at":"2024-04-07T07:24:48.752141-07:00","status":{"Error":"Failed to connect to OpenAI API: The model `gpt-4-turbo-preview` does not exist or you do not have access to it."}},"2":{"role":"user","sent_at":"2024-04-07T07:24:48.752282-07:00","status":"Done"},"3":{"role":"assistant","sent_at":"2024-04-07T07:31:40.324672-07:00","status":"Done"},"5":{"role":"assistant","sent_at":"2024-04-07T07:31:57.207499-07:00","status":"Done"},"0":{"role":"user","sent_at":"2024-04-07T07:24:38.538262-07:00","status":"Done"},"4":{"role":"user","sent_at":"2024-04-07T07:31:40.324888-07:00","status":"Done"}},"summary":"Testing functionality"}
