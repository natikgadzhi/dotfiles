# dotfiles

After cloning this repository, run `./install` to apply the dotfiles, that will work for both Mac and Linux boxes.

## Mac

This repository is structured to provide a way to roll dotfiles for generic Unix boxes, and then some extra settings for Mac systems:

- `./install` to setup dotfiles.
- `brew bundle install` to install most apps on a Mac. This will install apps from both Casks, and Mac App Store.

## Raycast

Raycast settings moved to Raycast cloud account. Raycast needs `~/src/raycast/yubico-oath.sh` to be present to support yubikey 2FA command.
